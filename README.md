# Image Recognition and Classification using Deep Learning

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project demonstrates image recognition and classification using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## 📂 Dataset
- CIFAR-10 (10 classes, 60,000 32x32 color images)

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Google Colab
- Matplotlib

## 🚀 Steps Implemented
1. Load and preprocess the data
2. Build a CNN model
3. Train the model on training data
4. Evaluate model on test data
5. Visualize accuracy and loss
6. Make predictions on new data

## 📈 Results
Achieved over 70% accuracy on test data with basic CNN architecture. Can be improved with data augmentation and deeper models.

## 📌 How to Run
- Open the notebook in Google Colab
- Run all cells step by step
